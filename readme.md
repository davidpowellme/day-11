##Design Research

###What is it?
1. Plan
2. Observe
3. Design
4. Prototype
5. Test  
Cyclical process for each iteration

###Why do we perform it?
- A lot of times you might be solving problems for clients that the client doesn't even know exists.
- Visual design should be supporting functionality of the product.
- Gives your client a competitive edge.
- Helps you to create a list of valid goals that will yield positive result.

###Without it...
- Risk Factors go up
    + you can go off brand
    + possibility of insulting audience
    + harms user experience
    + mismatched trends leads to...
- Heavy reliance on design trends
    + some things will stop being cool (long shadow)
    + some things are everygreen (material design)

###Examples
- Spotify
    + Their purpose: sell subscriptions to their streaming service and get users for ads
    + User's purpose: listen to any and all music whenever you want
    + How they're using design
        * First things first CTA sell (try free!)
        * Then what it is in terms of the user (most people know spotify at this point - reinforce and make it cool with features)
        * Use fun, bright, clear colors and fonts
        * Appealing to a younger or at least tech-savvy market
        * site feels like an electronic or pop song
- Evernote
    + Their purpose: sell subscriptions
    + User's purpose: Organize life easily and without clutter or notebooks. Digital solution for organization
    + How they're using design
        * Started with "Why" - remember everything
        * Only after succintly telling you why their product matters do they first offer free, then show CTAs easily and efficiently for sales
        * After CTA for those unsure, better listings of how Evernote can improve your life
        * Use earthy, calming, clear but professional and homie colors and fonts
        * Site feels like a clean home office in your secluded cabin
        * marketing to family/professionals/work from homes
- Calendly
    + Their purpose: sign up users
    + User's purpose: make it easy for people to schedule meetings based on your availability - automation
    + How They're using design
        * super uncluttered
        * dr's office feel
        * it has facts, it has clear CTAs and client testimonials
        * not much going on, not much to distract
        * Keeping it simple and easy to forget
- Pocket
    + Their purpose: get users to download an app or make an account
    + User's purpose: stop forgetting to read things you don't have time to read now
    + How they're using design
        * Literary, newsie feel
        * Stupid simple, but puts you in that ideal situation with a cup of coffee where you are catching up on the articles you missed during your break at a coffee shop
        * Very straightforward, a product that does one thing and does it well
        * Lightweight
        * Warm
        * Love the minimalist feel, like a well constructed sentence: everything is there but it's the minimal effective dose
- Medium
    + Their purpose: Get people to read or write.
    + User's purpose: read or write things that have substance and can be easily shared. Distribute ideas. Consume ideas. Move thinking forward (as stated).
    + How they're using design
        * Whitespace and fonts convey clear head
        * Brief intro, then no distraction from reading or writing
        * Clean and clear, using images as accents and content
        * made for reading - small width for easily scanning and digesting

**NO MORE "I like" or any criticism without backing it up**

#Regal Ravioli

Visted and ordered cheese ravioli. The employee who took my order also cooked my food and served me. I got there around 12:15 and was the only one there, but by the time I left at 12:45 there were around 10 people there and another employee (or maybe the owner) was helping to serve.

The customers seemed to be a mix of part-timers and tech employees on their lunch breaks. Yelp (and the fact this place has been around 5 years) suggests that they have a loyal following who love them but many people who are unimpressed.

The food was decent, but I understand why people think it's expensive for what you get. Plating is a big deal, and these were served in pie pans and tin foil. I got the impression this a place that doesn't have a firm identity and is satisfied that it's making money.

##SWOT Analysis

###Strengths
- BYOB with tent and picnic table ambience
- Location
    + many food trucks and coffee shops and stores around, people likely to try it just because it's there.
    + ample parking
    + covered seating
- handmade pasta
- friendly service
    + employees offer samples
    + bring food out to you
- hosts meetups and active in many ATX food networks
- SEO KILLING IT for "ravioli austin"
- Definite niche

###Weakenesses
- people from the northeast say it doesn't compare to italian food there (which is what it's supposed to do)
- mismatched pricing vs atmosphere, location, quality
- signature dish underwhelming to many
- high price
- ambiguous brand identity

###Opportunities

    + nice mean/funny joe pesci humor
